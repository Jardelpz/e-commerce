# Simple E-commerce

The idea behind this work is to design how a simple e-commerce works. Logging data, user controls,
authenticated requests, email reminders, blocks and other materials.

## Getting Started

### Running the project 
    * Set up your credencials at .env
    * docker-compose up -d


## Next Step

This project should logically be in microservices, so, to continue, it is necessary to separate these services
   and start developing order processing and payments.
